## About

Unreal Engine 4 plug-in that demonstrates how to use the Plug-in Warden.  This is a complete example of how you would suggest to the user to properly license your plug-in from the Marketplace if you've decided your editor plug-in should be licensed on a per-seat basis.  You'll need to discuss with the Marketplace team about the specifics if you decide to do that.

You'll need to replace the,
* GET_ITEM_ID_FROM_MARKETPLACE_STAFF with the ItemID
* GET_OFFER_ID_FROM_MARKETPLACE_STAFF with the OfferID

Both of which you'll get from the marketplace team when talking with them about getting your plugin on the store.

NOTE: The Plug-in Warden will not, nor will it ever stop someone from pirating a plug-in, it could help convert users who accidentally violate the per-seat terms of the license though.


## Supported Platforms

This plug-in was last built against **Unreal Engine 4.11**. It works on all editor
